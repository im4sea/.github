All tools and models emphasize data protection, transparency, interoperability, and the “do no harm” approach throughout the data lifecycle.

## Collaboration

IM4SEA collaborates with OCHA country offices, humanitarian partners, government institutions, and research and technology actors to advance regional information management, AI innovation, and data engineering capacity.  
Contributions, feedback, and shared development are encouraged through open repositories and regional collaboration spaces.

## Governance

IM4SEA is coordinated by the **OCHA ROSEA Information Management Unit**, in collaboration with regional and country-level IM officers.  
All repositories follow OCHA’s open data and interoperability principles to ensure transparency, sustainability, and reusability.
