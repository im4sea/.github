# IM4SEA

**IM4SEA - Information Management for Southern & Eastern Africa** is an initiative of the **United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs – Regional Office for Southern and Eastern Africa (OCHA ROSEA)** that advances open, collaborative data systems and tools to strengthen humanitarian information management across the region. It focuses on maintaining and sharing open, interoperable tools, workflows, and analytical systems that improve data management and analysis for coordinated humanitarian action. IM4SEA is not a replacement for OCHA's [Information Management Toolbox](https://humanitarian.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/imtoolbox/overview?homepageId=42012406), which provides global guidance, templates, and standards for humanitarian information management.

## Mission

To strengthen humanitarian information management through open, scalable, and responsible technologies that improve evidence-based decision-making, operational efficiency, and regional collaboration.

## Focus Areas

- Data engineering, pipelines, and automation workflows  
- Geospatial and statistical analysis for humanitarian insights  
- AI-driven data modeling, analytics, and decision-support tools  
- Tools and guidelines for information visualization and reporting  
- Standards and integration guidelines for interoperability  
- Ethical and responsible data practices aligned with OCHA policies  

## Data Responsibility

IM4SEA adheres to the [OCHA Data Responsibility Guidelines](https://centre.humdata.org/revised-ocha-data-responsibility-guidelines/), ensuring that all data and technologies are managed responsibly, ethically, and in line with [Principles of Humanitarian Inforamtion Management](https://humanitarian.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/imtoolbox/pages/219807814/Principles+of+Humanitarian+IM).  

All tools and models emphasize data protection, transparency, interoperability, and the “do no harm” approach throughout the data lifecycle.

## Collaboration

IM4SEA collaborates with OCHA country offices, humanitarian partners, government institutions, researchers, voluntary contributors and technology actors to advance regional information management, AI innovation, and data engineering capacity.  

Contributions, feedback, and shared development are encouraged through open repositories and regional collaboration spaces. All contributions whether by individuals or organizations are expected to adhere to open-source principles and community guidelines. No financial compensation or billable hours are associated with these contributions, as participation is entirely voluntary and aimed at collective improvement and knowledge sharing.

## Governance

IM4SEA is coordinated by the **OCHA ROSEA Information Management Team**, in collaboration with regional and country-level IM officers.  
All repositories follow OCHA’s open data and interoperability principles to ensure transparency, sustainability, and reusability.

## Contact
